title: About Me
---

I work at WalmartLabs as a Soft­ware En­gin­eer, with a prior experience of around 2 years in Adobe Systems. I cur­rently live and work in Bengaluru, In­dia. I am a post-gradu­ate from National Institute of Technology, Trichy with a ma­jor in Computer Science. I love pro­gram­ming and my spe­cific fields of in­terest are Machine Learning, Nat­ural Lan­guage Pro­cessing, In­form­a­tion Re­trieval and Soft­ware En­gin­eer­ing. 

I am currently doing research under the mentorship of Prof. Indrajeet Mukherjee on few research projects related to Natural Language Process and Genetic Algorithms

I have an apetite for in­form­a­tion about pretty much any­thing un­der the sun. I like vari­ety and have a propensity to keep try­ing dif­fer­ent things.Besides this, I am a football enthusiast and a big fan of Manchester United. I follow English Premier League closely and also love playing football.
