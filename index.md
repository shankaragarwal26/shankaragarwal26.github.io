Hi!

My name is Shankar and I would like to define myself as a trenchant & energetic individual .I love writing code, designing complex systems and catching up with the tech world by rapidly learning new things every now and then. I am an avid thinker and have a keen interest in the fields of Machine Learning, NLP and the likes. Beyond my technical skills, I possess an aptitude for reading and writing. I am also a football enthusiast and actively follow Manchester United during my spare time.

(I try to update my website when I get time. If you want any updated information, please contact me on my email address)
